A good friend of mine has been working on a very interesting project: mapping Canadian Army's Battle of Normandy in which they've mapped out "20,000 mapped unit positions from Canadian, British, American, Free French, Polish and German armies"; which is going to be the largest georeferenced database of military positions in the world. 

They even made a cool video describing the project:

While they're doing some interesting work on the mapping end (which I'd also like to have a look into), I asked if they had any aspatial data I might want to look into, and he shared a file with me containing the casualties of the Battle of Normandy, the Canadian battle following the storming of Juno Beach:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
cas <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("./content/post/Project44_Casualty-List_v3.xlsx"))

glimpse(cas)

```

The dataset records 4,608 deaths occurring between the 6th of June and the 31st of August, 1944; on the subject, Chruchill infamously notes that raiding the beaches of Normandy was just the beginning. I'd like to explore what that beginning looked like in this post.

## Cleaning and Summary Stats

```{r, eval = TRUE, results='hide'}

cas <- cas %>% 
  select(age_text, date_of_death, rank, Division, regiment, cemeterymemorial) %>% 
  mutate(date_of_death = lubridate::dmy(date_of_death ),
         age = as.numeric(age_text))

```


I'm not sure what to look at with this data, but from a historical perspective I think several things are interesting to note: the bloodiest days, the units those men were from, their age, and which cemetary they were buried in.

```{r}
head(summarytools::freq(cas$date_of_death, order = "freq", style = "rmarkdown"), 5)

```

How about their age by Division?

```{r}
head(ctable(cas$age, cas$Division, prop = "n", style = "rmarkdown"), method = "render", 15)

cas %>% 
  filter(!is.na(age_text)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_text)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal()

```

There is a very young age curve, and some 1,233 ```NA``` values for age, or about a quarter of the dataset.
