<p>###Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).</p>
<p>&lt; ““is computer use during weekdays and weekends at 16 years old associated with depression at 18 years old?”,&quot;</p>
<p>Project questions
The primary questions to be answered by the project will be:
1. How do teams’ results compare to the multiverse of results?
2. How does the variability of teams’ results compare the variability of the multiverse of
results?
3. How does each team’s results compare to all the other teams’ results?
4. What are effective ways of visually communicating the above comparisons?
Secondary project questions to be answered will be:
5. Does domain expertise affect the results of teams’ analyses?
6. Does statistical expertise affect the results of teams’ analyses?
7. Are teams’ subjective beliefs about the research question associated with the results
of teams’ analyses?
8. Does the anonymisation process affect the results of teams’ analyses?</p>
<p>Importantly, we also
attempted to adjust for a range of other activities in
order to identify what other activities are sacrificed for
screen time. Such measures include time spent outside,
time spent socialising, and time spent alone</p>
<p>“Anxiety and depression were measured at approximately
18 years, using a self-administered, computerised version
of the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) [18]
completed during a study clinic. The CIS-R asks questions
about a range of symptoms and can be used to assign
ICD-10 diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders”</p>
<p>“In summary, our results suggest that increased computer use at age 16 is associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety at age 18, although causality cannot be ascertained. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was little evidence of an effect of time spent texting or watching TV on risk of anxiety and depression indicating there may be a more complex relationship between screen time and mental health outcomes than simply more screen time increasing risk.”</p>
